# Host


File Blocker on native level rather than relying on Adblockers as sometimes adblockers couldn’t parse and the connection would still be needed to intercepted by adblocker.
Host file would work with OS low level network modules to efficiently just return nothing as the request to the domain isn’t made in the first place.


Great host file maintained by community
